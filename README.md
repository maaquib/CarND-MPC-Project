### The Model

The kinematic model used in the project is the one described in the lessons and uses the vehicles position (`x, y`), orientation (`psi`) and velocity (`v`). Using these variables to construct a state vector we can predict where it will be in the future after timestep `dt`. Additionally, we also want to capture how errors affect the state of the vehicle. We include the cross track error (`cte`) and the orientation error (`epsi`) in the state, to minimize the difference between the actual and reference trajectories.

```cpp
x[t + 1] = x[t] + v[t] * cos(psi[t]) * dt;
y[t + 1] = y[t] + v[t] * sin(psi[t]) * dt;
psi[t + 1] = psi[t] - (v[t] / Lf) * delta[t] * dt;
v[t + 1] = v[t] + a[t] * dt;
cte[t + 1] = (f[t] - y[t]) + (v[t] * sin(epsi[t]) * dt);
epsi[t + 1] = (psi[t] - psides[t]) - ((v[t] / Lf) * delta[t] * dt);
```

`Lâ€‹f` measures the distance between the front of the vehicle and its center of gravity in our `psi` and `cte` equations. Since the perception of rotation in the simulator is reversed, we use `- Lf` instead of what was provided (`+ Lf`) as part of the model equations in the lessons.

Using the above set of model equations we can provide the system with actuator values to control and change the state of the vehicle.

### Timestep Length and Elapsed Duration (N & dt)
The values chosen for Timestep Length are `N = 10` and for Elapsed Duration `dt = 0.1`.

I tried using `N = 15` but did not see much improvement at the cost of additional computation, so decided to stick with N = 10. Using a value smaller than 0.1 dt (`dt = 0.05`) caused larger oscillations around the track center with the vehicle rolling over the curb at times. Although, I believe modifying the cost factor multipliers would have led to a better performance, I did not explore this further in the interest of time.

Using a smaller `dt` value is preferable since it would give finer resolution for the vehicle trajectory. However, having too small a value would mean computational overhead and predictions which are a bit too responsive to changes.

Having a small N may lead to prediction which may lack continuity and smoothness. On the flip side, having a large N can not only cause higher computational latency, it would also not make much sense to predict actuator values for too far ahead in time. Since this is not a dynamic model, predicted values too far ahead in the future would be fairly inaccurate.

Shorter time horizon (`N * dt`) would lead to less accurate predictions although it would be more responsive to turns. On the flip side, a longer time horizon the drive would be smoother but less responsive to turns.

### Polynomial Fitting and MPC Preprocessing
Before fitting the polynomials, there is preprocessing that is done on the provided waypoints. Since the waypoints are in map perspective, they are transformed to vehicle perspective using the approach described [here](https://discussions.udacity.com/t/waypoints-going-crazy/270597/2).

```cpp
for (int i = 0; i < ptsx.size(); ++i) {
  waypoints_x_vals.push_back(cos(-psi) * (ptsx[i] - px)
                        - sin(-psi) * (ptsy[i] - py));
  waypoints_y_vals.push_back(sin(-psi) * (ptsx[i] - px)
                        + cos(-psi) * (ptsy[i] - py));
}
```

Following this, a third order polynomial is fitted (`polyfit` function) through the transformed waypoints and the `coeffs` obtained are used to predict the error in actual and reference trajectories. The initial state vector is then constructed and used for MPC processing.

### Model Predictive Control with Latency
To deal with latency in applying actuator controls to the vehicle (100ms), I used the kinematic model equations to predict the state after the latency period.

```cpp
double delta = j[1]["steering_angle"];
double throttle = j[1]["throttle"];

delta *= -1;
px = v * cos(delta) * latency;
py = v * sin(delta) * latency;
cte += v * sin(epsi) * latency;
epsi += v * delta * latency / Lf;
psi = v * delta * latency / Lf;
v += throttle * latency;
```

This new state is then sent to the MPC controller for getting the actuator values. This makes the vehicle handle latency correctly.

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./mpc`.

## Tips

1. It's recommended to test the MPC on basic examples to see if your implementation behaves as desired. One possible example
is the vehicle starting offset of a straight line (reference). If the MPC implementation is correct, after some number of timesteps
(not too many) it should find and track the reference line.
2. The `lake_track_waypoints.csv` file has the waypoints of the lake track. You could use this to fit polynomials and points and see of how well your model tracks curve. NOTE: This file might be not completely in sync with the simulator so your solution should NOT depend on it.
3. For visualization this C++ [matplotlib wrapper](https://github.com/lava/matplotlib-cpp) could be helpful.)
4.  Tips for setting up your environment are available [here](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/0949fca6-b379-42af-a919-ee50aa304e6a/lessons/f758c44c-5e40-4e01-93b5-1a82aa4e044f/concepts/23d376c7-0195-4276-bdf0-e02f1f3c665d)
5. **VM Latency:** Some students have reported differences in behavior using VM's ostensibly a result of latency.  Please let us know if issues arise as a result of a VM environment.

## Editor Settings

We've purposefully kept editor configuration files out of this repo in order to
keep it as simple and environment agnostic as possible. However, we recommend
using the following settings:

* indent using spaces
* set tab width to 2 spaces (keeps the matrices in source code aligned)

## Code Style

Please (do your best to) stick to [Google's C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

## Project Instructions and Rubric

Note: regardless of the changes you make, your project must be buildable using
cmake and make!

More information is only accessible by people who are already enrolled in Term 2
of CarND. If you are enrolled, see [the project page](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/f1820894-8322-4bb3-81aa-b26b3c6dcbaf/lessons/b1ff3be0-c904-438e-aad3-2b5379f0e0c3/concepts/1a2255a0-e23c-44cf-8d41-39b8a3c8264a)
for instructions and the project rubric.

## Hints!

* You don't have to follow this directory structure, but if you do, your work
  will span all of the .cpp files here. Keep an eye out for TODOs.

## Call for IDE Profiles Pull Requests

Help your fellow students!

We decided to create Makefiles with cmake to keep this project as platform
agnostic as possible. Similarly, we omitted IDE profiles in order to we ensure
that students don't feel pressured to use one IDE or another.

However! I'd love to help people get up and running with their IDEs of choice.
If you've created a profile for an IDE that you think other students would
appreciate, we'd love to have you add the requisite profile files and
instructions to ide_profiles/. For example if you wanted to add a VS Code
profile, you'd add:

* /ide_profiles/vscode/.vscode
* /ide_profiles/vscode/README.md

The README should explain what the profile does, how to take advantage of it,
and how to install it.

Frankly, I've never been involved in a project with multiple IDE profiles
before. I believe the best way to handle this would be to keep them out of the
repo root to avoid clutter. My expectation is that most profiles will include
instructions to copy files to a new location to get picked up by the IDE, but
that's just a guess.

One last note here: regardless of the IDE used, every submitted project must
still be compilable with cmake and make./
